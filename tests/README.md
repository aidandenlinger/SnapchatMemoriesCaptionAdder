Run the tests via `just test` or `python -m tests.test` from the **root of the repo.**

The tests don't actually assert a ton :( This is really just a quick way to generate a specific example, but it'll need to be checked by a human.

`memories_history.json` and `memories` should serve as an example of what should go in the `input` folder.
Their output will be in `tests/test_output`.
